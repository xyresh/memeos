# memeos
 idiotic attempt at building an operating system.


 this is based on the OSDev guide, https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones, where the bootloader along with some initial parts of the kernel have been taken from.

 as features are added, and it slowly morphs into an actual funtioning os many features may be inspired or taken (stolen) from other FOSS operating systems.
 However i will try my best to implement most features by myself.

# Goal
 goal of this project is mainly a learning excercise for me to learn how operating systems work, and how the software-hardware gap is bridged by an operating system,
 and how the os plays a big role in the addition of layers of abstraction.
